<Layout title="404 Not Found">
    <h1>404 Not Found</h1>
    <p>
        The HTTP 404 Not Found response status code indicates that the server cannot find the
        requested resource. Links that lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links and
        can be subject to link rot. (from MDN Web Docs)

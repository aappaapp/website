# Why do i use Astro to build my websites?

## Introduction

[There are so many JavaScript frameworks out there.](https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/) So why did I use [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) to build my websites? There are few reasons.

## 1. Astro is easy to use and blazingly fast.

Astro is very easy to use (See reason 2). It uses islands, which means there are no 100GB JSX runtime being shipped to the client by default.

## 2. Astro uses a syntax similar to JSX

Astro uses a syntax similar to JSX. And I know [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) (which uses JSX), so it's very easy to learn and migrate.

JSX:

```jsx
<div>JSX NUMBAH WAN</div>
```

Astro:

```astro
<div>Astro is easy</div>
```

They are fundamentally the same.

## 3. I can use components from other frameworks.

import Counter from "./_components/why-astro.tsx";

Astro have a lots of [integration](https://astro.build/integrations/). And I can use mdx and solidjs without a lot of configuration.

I can insert a solid component: <Counter client:load />

And the code is just:

```mdx
import Counter from "./_components/why-astro.tsx";

Astro have a lots of [integration](https://astro.build/integrations/). And I can use mdx and solidjs without a lot of configuration.

I can insert a solid component: <Counter client:load />
```

# Conclusion

I use Astro (maybe i will switch to another framework someday)

# Why do i use Astro to build this site?

## 1. It is easy to use.

[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#easy-to-use) said:

> Astroâ€™s goal is to be accessible to every web developer

(and I do not need the server stuff in Next.js)

## 2. I can use solid.js.

import Counter from "./_components/why-astro.tsx";

Astro have built in [integration](https://astro.build/integrations/) for a lot of frameworks.

So i can insert a solid component:

<Counter client:load />

# Conclusion

I use Astro (maybe i will change someday)

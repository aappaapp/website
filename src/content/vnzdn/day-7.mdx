# Day 7: No zero days November

A week has passed and the progress has been ... reasonable. I can not hide the fact that I'm a bit disappointed in what I managed to achieve as I expected to have a lot more work done within the first week. The reasons why I do this 30 day challenge is to make good progress on GoZen and the other reason is to have more consistency in videos on my channel ... so I'm failing at both so far. ^^" My channel is not growing and I'm afraid if it continues in this trend of being stuck at this level the chance that I can continue working full-time on my projects will become more difficult as I'll have to get a job again at some point.

## Progress report

Today I worked on separating the gdextension code which I had in the main repo of GoZen and I'm transferring everything to a separate repo to make it easier available for other people who want to implement ffmpeg into their project. The GDExtension itself will be called the GoZenLibrary and all modules will have GoZen in the name such as the GoZenImporter and the GoZenRenderer. Why do I name them like that? Promoting GoZen? Because I think it sounds good? Nope, basically I am terrible at naming things such as my rabbit from my childhood which I called snowball as it was a very big white rabbit which looked like a giant snowball.

I've also been working on the first version of the rendering system for GoZen. When this is done I can take a small break from ffmpeg related stuff and work on more fun things such as the timeline. When that's working I'll be able to test if GoZen can create video files properly with this system or not. After that I could get into working with the audio related stuff. I'll have to get back at importing videos at some point though, but being able to render out something into a video file with audio would really be the motivation boost I need right now. ^^

## Given myself extra work?

Creating the extra repo for the GDExtension stuff first looked like extra work, but the more I think about it the more I think that this is a good move. This way people who want to contribute on the ffmpeg extension can do so without having to worry about all other GoZen related code. It has a couple more benefits but basically doing it like this did not actually give me any extra work except for creating a new bash file to generate the library, and copy-paste it into the bin folder of the Godot project.

## Conclusion

Progress is not what I had been expected, but I'm not letting my mood go down too much because of this. The rendering system is coming along nicely, hopefully I can finish this tomorrow so I can create a new progress video. In short, much work is left, but we are getting dangerously close to a first version of GoZen which will actually be able to generate video files!! Although those video files will most likely only consists of static colors and maybe text ^^"

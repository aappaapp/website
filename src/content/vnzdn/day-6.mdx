# Day 6: No zero days November

So today was a calm day of making progress, spend around an hour on GoZen and the rest went to finishing up the program which I made in Godot to help me make 10 hour long videos for my Japanese teaching YouTube channel. All by all I am very happy with how my day went and having a break from the ffmpeg stuff was needed.

## FFMPEG progress

Progress has been made, especially my progress in understanding ffmpeg and video files. I thought I had the basics down but it turned out that it was just the tip of the iceberg. Lots more have to be learned and from all the knowledge I am gaining, I'm writing my own instructional manual as I intend to make some "quality" videos about ffmpeg and how to work with it. Most tutorials about it are kind of outdated at this point, and there is only 1 series which I would actually recommend watching if you want to learn about ffmpeg, which is the series I mentioned in the previous Day 5 post.

## Where to now?

I'll continue the next couple of days to make progress on this part of the editor, the ffmpeg stuff is too important and is over 50% of the total work which the editor needs. There won't be any early optimizing!! I just want to learn about ffmpeg for now, and get the basics done, which are loading videos and audio into memory which can be used in Godot. Optimizing will be for a later stage as my next mission will be the timeline and other editor functionalities.

## Conclusion

At the beginning of this no zero days challenge I was thinking of completing 1 feature a day ... well that's not going to happen anymore. But I'm glad that I finally started on the heavy parts, this means less content for Voylin's Gamedev Journey, but that kind of a period was going to come at some point anyway. Looking forward to making the next video in this series where I can show of my C++ code which I'm certain will give people headaches! ðŸ˜‰

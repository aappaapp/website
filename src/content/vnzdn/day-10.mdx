# Day 10: No zero days November

Today not much of a long explanation. It has been a rough day, and progress has been made but life got busy. Friday's are my Japanese class days, so yeah.

## Progress

The progress which I made had to do with ffmpeg. Still struggling with it but it's going better each day as I gain more knowledge on the matter. Importer is something which will require more time, but it'll be great if the renderer would work.

## Conclusion

I've been working on balancing all things which I should do. I started using Obsidian in an attempt to increase my productivity, I'll see in 30 days of it actually helped or not. For GoZen I'll keep using github projects.

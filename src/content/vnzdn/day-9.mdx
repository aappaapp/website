# Day 9: No zero days November

Today was filming, ffmpeg and cleanup day. Been going through all the code and files of GoZen to create a bit more structure and also been working more on the ffmpeg stuff. I feel that I am more and more getting a good grasp on the library.

## Licensing

The GDExtension, GoZen-ffmpeg, changed to the MIT license so people can use the extension more freely in their projects. I've also started doing a bit more research work about the license ffmpeg has and a better license for GoZen. So far not much progress on that part though. I don't really care what people use the GDExtension for as long as the GoZen specific code stay's good.

## FFMPEG GDExtension

Right now my main goal for the GDExtension is to have a way of importing and exporting video files. Nothing more, but later on I would like to create an overall interface which will give access to the ffmpeg library in a more free and custom way. THIS WAY WILL REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE TO USE!! As you'll be able to see in the video which I'll release today or tomorrow, you'll notice a file which is not in the repo called gozen_interface. This will mainly be the class you'll use to call individual ffmpeg stuff. More on that later when the whole 'interface' is more matured and after I released the importer and renderer in a working state.

### Tutorials?

I'm planning on making tutorials on how to use ffmpeg as there are not many up to date resources on haow to use FFMPEG 4.0. But I have no idea if people will actually be interested in these as they don't have too much in common with game development. ^^" Still, it's programming related and I feel that it could help people so I am slowly investing a bit in time in sorting my notes of what I learned to make these into nice information packed videos.

## Last poll

So the last poll resulted in ffmpeg winning, so that's what I'll be focussing on for now. What I'll also start focusing on is investing a bit more time in my other youtube channels so I can keep my income from those somewhat steady during this head breaking No zero days November. This journey has been 9 days so far, but I realized that this should be how I work on Gozen in general, **DAILY**.

My underlying goal this month should be on how I can work on GoZen in a full time way, whilst also have enough time to work on my other youtube channels, spend time with my kid, and do my stay at home dad duties. So far the progress I was able to do daily was not much and I only programmed on GoZen for an average of 4 days each week. I would like to work on GoZen for minimum 30 minutes to an hour each day.

## Today's conclusion

This whole No zero days November journey has opened my eyes and has been a great learning experience for me. I'll keep working on getting some kind of routine/schedule to be able to keep doing all of this (programming, youtube, gozen, stay-at-home-dad, family time) full time. I got the feeling that I am on a horizontal line in my progress of succeeding in this, not going down, not going up. So yeah, I'll try my best! ^^

# Day 5: No zero days November

I've been taking it calm today, went to one of the big parks a bit further where I live so I could have some good bicycle time as well. My kid enjoyed the slides whilst I was emptying my head a bit. After getting back I started reading up various resources and I already decided from the early morning that I won't be coding today but first writing out what needs to happen instead of blindly trying to make things work as this does not work for this part of the project.

## FFMPEG or MLT?

I decided to stick with FFMPEG, MLT framework has a lot of stuff available, however most of the features won't be needed as Godot will fill that gap. So ffmpeg it is, I found a couple of new resources to learn ffmpeg with and I have been taking this day to go through them all together with my notebook. I usually plan out before doing, I don't know why I didn't properly do this for the ffmpeg part, I had read resources and examples though. Most of the stuff I found was for older versions and the way I was trying to get the frame data was inefficient and even if it would have worked, performance would have been too bad to even use it (even for an mvp, talking about just a couple frames per second).

## Resources

I think it could be helpful for other people to see which resources I am going through:

-   https://www.openshot.org/ja/blog/ (OpenShot blog to see how he made his progress on OpenShot)
-   http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.html (This is for ffmpeg version 2.x, now we are at 4.0 so outdated but the way of thinking/logic is the same)
-   https://ffmpeg.org/ (They have documentation and examples, even though I am not a fan at all of this site, still going through it to try and understand it)
-   https://github.com/kidrigger/Godot-video-reference
-   https://github.com/EIRTeam/EIRTeam.FFmpeg
-   https://github.com/leandromoreira/ffmpeg-libav-tutorial
-   https://proc-cpuinfo.fixstars.com/2017/08/ffmpeg-api-decode/ (Also outdated .... and in Japanese)
-   https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKucWgGjAuTbobNC28EaR9lbGQTVyD9IS&si=Ink4wkrr4iGPdfhl

Those are some of the main ones I'm going/went through

## Conclusion

I had a day full of struggles yesterday and hitting walls, I feel that I am slowly building a ladder to cross the wall which I am facing now. I also stopped trying to film the progress everyday as I really need to figure this part out as fast as possible so I don't lose too much time during this month. I will publish a video at day 7 with a summary of the previous days. But that's it for now, no need to worry as GoZen is making progress again. I knew the ffmpeg would take time, but yesterday I felt like I wasted 6 hours and I really got myself down. ^^" Ohwell, back to my positive self and GoZen's future is looking a bit brighter again!

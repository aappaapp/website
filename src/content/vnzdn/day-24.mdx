# Day 24: No zero days November

Giving up for today.

## Audio is noisy

I don't know why the audio is so noisy. I tried changing the format of the audio to unsigned pcm 8 ... but end result is still a noisy mess. I'll try looking around forums to see if I can find people with similar problems, but that will be for tomorrow. I have other things I should also really work on. ^^"

## Conclusion

Very short update post for today, yesterday we achieved video, and I don't want to break my head entirely after having a great progress day such as yesterday. I gained some knowledge, I got one step further, now it's time to let everything sink in and try again tomorrow. Tomorrow will be a short day as well as it is cleaning day in my wife's parents house and I am the only one who can clean/fix airconditioners ^^"

# Day 4: No zero days November

Was a very stressful day, I made progress even though nothing is working. ^^"

## FFMPEG

Basically, examples are outdated, or just not clear. Having a very hard time going through them and making progress. I was thinking to use MLT framework, but I can find even less information about that one.
##My worries
I don't know if it's because I am tired, but I am starting to worry if this project will even be possible without getting ffmpeg to work properly in the way we want. Without it we won't be able to generate thumbnails nor videos. Encoding and decoding was something that I was hoping that ffmpeg could handle. So I should probably try to find somebody with enough ffmpeg knowledge, or find another way. I don't want to give up on this project, but I am completely stuck and this will become impossible (unless if we only use theora files, than there may be a possiblity ^^").

## Conclusion

I've reached a low in the development from GoZen, it's still possible that I can recover and make it work ... but at what time cost will that be. However, I started No zero days November so I'll keep investing time daily into GoZen, working hard on making it work! But this does change the entire roadmap. ^^"

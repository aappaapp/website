# Day 16: No zero days November

Since day 4 or so the only thing I have been talking about in these updates is **ffmpeg**. Both ffmpeg and Godot are the core parts of GoZen to make GoZen into a reality.

## Progress

Started working on the demuxer today. Demuxing is basically taking a video container and separating the streams of data (video, audio, subtitles). After this part is succesful, we still need to decode the video stream so we can actually display it. I've slowly started learning about audio as well as this could come in handy for one of my projects for my other channel, still a long way to go though.

## Conclusion

Ooohhhh, we're halfway there! (Points if you get the reference) IT's officially the halfway marker of No zero days November, I hope I can get to the timeline before this month is over. At this point I'll be happy if I can finish the ffmpeg stuff to be honest hahaha. So far it has been a very nice learning experience, learned more about Godot, GDExtensions, ffmpeg and how to handle programming fulltime whilst being a stay at home dad/youtuber. :p

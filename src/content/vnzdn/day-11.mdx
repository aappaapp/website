# Day 11: No zero days November

This one will be short ...

## Progress

I was able to get a couple steps further in creating the importer.

## What's wrong?

Got a migraine again but heavier than normal this time. I felt it coming yesterday, made me unable to fall asleep easily, could only fall asleep past midnight. When I woke up I felt fine, did some programming until the screen went black and fuzzy (not my pc screen but my view). Followed by a massive headache.

## I'll be fine

I have migraines monthly, this one is a lot worse then any which I had before though. Went for a walk to get some sunlight and fresh air with my kid. Got ice around my neck, this ussually helps A LOT! Been spending most of my day in the dark, windows closed and avoiding screens. I finally gave up and took some medicine (something I very rarely do).

## Conclusion

Not a zero day in terms of progress, but my migraines usually last a couple of days, up to a week. I'm not certain yet if this will have a big overal impact the next couple of days, so let's hope it won't. ^^" Anyway, I'll be spending the rest of my day in darkness trying to keep my kid entertained and trying to cook a healthy meal so I can get better soon. These first day's of my migraines are some of the most terrible ones when my wife's at work like today as my kid can make my migraine a lot worse ... ^^"

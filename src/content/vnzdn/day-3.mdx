# Day 3: No zero days November

Today was a more difficult day as we had a family trip, at the time of writing this I'm still in the car on our way home.

## What did I achieve today?

Today I worked on a small feature, the start screen image will change depending on the season. This is something very small, and unnecessary, but I only had about 30 minutes this morning so not much time for anything else.

As we were going to a far place I put some reading materials on my phone to learn a bit more about ffmpeg together with some examples of how other projects implemented its functionality.

## Bugs

One of the things we did today was going to an insect museum, this has nothing to do with GoZen, but made me think of it would be fun to make an ant colony simulator ðŸ˜‚

## Conclusion

I had a fun day, not a zero day, but I really wish that I could have made more progress, but spending time with family is also important.

Tomorrow I'll be working on more important features of GoZen. Sorry for this not so interesting update. ðŸ˜…
